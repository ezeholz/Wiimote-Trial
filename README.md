# Wiimote-Trial

This project consists of a research and future insertion of the code generated in Processing to be able to use the Wiimote.

According to recent research, everything relevant to the Wiimote within the programming in Processing is outdated, having the libraries to use in the version of Processing 2, but already having version 3 of the aforementioned program.

The same is a personal project that seeks to operate the Wiimote to the latest version, to be able to attach it to Kinect libraries and use them together.
